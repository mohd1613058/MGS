It is an automatic grievance system which means that even if a person does not know where to send the grievance, to which authority, it will automatically send it to the concerned authority or department. It tries to remove a lot of manual work involved in separating different grievances or complaints as they arrive at the system and sending them to the concerned authority or department. It is a very simple 3 step process in which 1st step includes, log in or sign up where a user has to make an account or login through an existing one. The second step is to lodge a complaint or grievance by clicking on the section and submit it. The third step includes generating a token number, by which the user can track the status of a complaint. So, it is a very easy and effective way to raise your voice against anything wrong happening to you or in your surroundings.
